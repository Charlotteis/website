        <p>Microservices Day is a conference by the enterprise, for the enterprise. It brings together people from organizations that have adopted (or are planning to adopt) a microservices approach to running their business and focuses on the issues that companies face.

The event will consist of a range of talks from industry leaders who have deep experience building and operating microservices systems at scale. Panel discussions and active audience participation will be a further part of the event, as the implications of enabling business to innovate at a faster pace than ever before will be a key discussion point. Come join the early adopters at the dawn of a new era in business computing!</p>
